OLIVE (Opencv-LIVE) is a web-based, visual programming tool for real-time image, video, and 3D processing. It uses nodes to represent functions and wires (connections) to define the flow of media data between them, leveraging OpenCV.js, Three.js and MediaPipe.

To run the examples: hover over the "Open" icon (at the top right corner of the graph editor) and select a sample graph from the list or download the .olive files (not the images folder) to your PC and then load any of them, using the "Open" icon.
