OLIVE (OpenCV LIVE) is a web-based, visual programming tool for real-time image, video, and 3D processing. It uses nodes to represent functions and wires (connections) to define the flow of media data between them, leveraging OpenCV.js, Three.js and MediaPipe.

To run the examples download the .olive files (not the images folder) to your PC and load any of them using the open icon at the top right corner of the graph editor.
